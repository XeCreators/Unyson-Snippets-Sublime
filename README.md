Unyson is a framework for WordPress that facilitates the development of a theme.

This framework was created from the ground up by the team behind ThemeFuse from the desire to empower developers to build outstanding WordPress themes fast and easy.

## Installation

* Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Win, Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (OS X) to open the Command Palette.
* Type "Package Control: Install Package" and hit enter.
* Search for "Unyson Snippets" and hit enter to install.

## How To Use

* Just start typing "unyson-" to have all possible options displayed.
* Typing "uny-" or "un-" also works. At least it works for me ;-)
